 * Game ideas:
 *  * Fly as a swarm rather than single bee
 *    * Invidual bees can be lost and form "health"
 *    * Must have at least one bee to end the level
 *  * Collect pollen from flowers (cute) on the ground or from trees high up
 *  * Pollen forms the game's "currency"
 *    * Can be spent on buying more bees or making existing bees stronger
 *    * Can be spent on hive upgrades which will lead to more benefits
 *  * Enemies: wasps, pollution clouds, something else
 *  * Contact with an enemy leads to loss of one of the bees from the swarm
 *  * Levels will have fixed length so that it is possible to reach the end and "return to base"
